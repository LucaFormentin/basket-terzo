 * 1. Fetches the list of players using the `getPlayers` function.
 * 2. If no players are found, returns null.
 * 3. Initializes a new `PlayersCollection` instance.
 * 4. Retrieves entries from the `PlayersCollection`.
 * 5. If no entries are found, initializes the players in the collection.
 * 7. Maps the players to include fines data from the database.
 *
 * Each player object in the returned array includes also:
 * - `totalFines`: The total number of fines the player has.
 * - `stillToPay`: The number of fines that are still unpaid.
 * - `firebaseKey`: The key of the player entry in the database, or null if not found.
